# HumanComputerInteraction-Assignment2

Description: This is my second iteration on the Sheridan Course App that allows Users/Students to access information about their current courses. The goal is to provide a nicely designed and intuitive mobile application for courses at Sheridan College and is catered to users between the age of 18 to 35 and even users above the age of 45.
