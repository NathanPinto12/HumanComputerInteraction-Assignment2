# HumanComputerInteraction-Assignment2

Description: This is my second iteration on the Sheridan Course App that allows Users/Students to access information about their current courses. The goal is to provide a nicely designed and intuitive mobile application for courses at Sheridan College and is catered to users between the age of 18 to 35 and even users above the age of 45. 

Top 5 New Desirable Functionalities:
1. Calendar so that students can see when Professors have office hours and be able to book an appointment
2. Instructions/Map that can guide students to their classrooms if they're unfamiliar with the campus
3. Push notifications to remind students about important dates
4. Section that tells student current academic standing and current GPA
5. Chat rooms so that students/professors can commincate effectively. (Faster than sending emails)
